<p>A lot of Angular codes haven't still migrated to Angular 2, So it makes sense to refresh a bit on how to make custom directives in Angular 1. Before I show How to write custom directives, I will try to answer What are directives, and Why do we need custom directives.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">What are Directives?</h3>

<p>Directives are JavaScript functions that manipulate and add behaviors to HTML DOM elements. AngularJS extends HTML by providing directives that add functionaliaty to your markup and allow you to create powerful dynamic templates. Angular comes with numerous built in directives such as ngModel, ngController, ngApp, ngShow, ngIf, and ngRepeat. Angular also let's us build our own custom directives. Custom directives can be an element directive, an attribute directive, a Class directive, and even a comment directive.</p>

<h3 id="heading3">Why Do We Need a Custom Directives?</h3>

<p>Custom directives are ideal to refactor a block of code that will be reusable in multiple spots in our application. Writing custom directives would be on overkill for a reusable code that needs to render data from its controller (or its parent controller), or if that won't even need a controller. It can easly be separated out into a template and loaded to where its needed using ngInclude.</p>
<p>We need to write Custom directives for a fragment that will be needed to connect to more than one controller, or it needs to be rendered differently in different parameters. Custom directives are also ideal if there will be DOM manipulation on the reusable part.
<p>
<h3 id="heading3">How to Write a Custom Directive</h3>
First, We need to register it tp an angular module using module.directive API passing the name of the direcitve and a factory function.
The name of the directive is in a camelCase format and it gets normalizes to a snack-case in the view(HTML), when it's invoked. Let's say I have a module named app.users and I want to add a directive to that module. Following John Papa's style guide:

{% highlight javascript %}
angular
  .module('app.users')
  //directive takes the name of the directive and function
  .directive('userElement', userElement);
{% endhighlight %}
<p>It is in the factory function that we define the Directive Definition Object and we return it. The object takes a number of options as a property that determine the specificties of the directive. Some of the options are:

<h6 id="heading6">Restrict</h6>
<p>The restrict option is used to specify how a directive can be invoked on the page. There are four different ways in which a directive can be rendered to the page, so restrict property can be given any of these values. Its a good practice to use only 'A' and 'E' though.</p>
<ol>
<li>'A' value => gets rendered as an attribute</li>
<li>'E' value => gets rendered as an element</li>
<li>'C' value => gets added as class of the given element></li>
<li>'M' value => gets added as comment</li>
</ol>
{% highlight html %}
<!-- Attribute directive -->
<li user-element><li>
<!-- Element directive -->
<user-element></user-element>
<!-- Class directive -->
<li class="user-element"></li>
<!-- Comment directive -->
<!--directive: user-element -->
{% endhighlight %}
<h6 id="heading6">Replace</h6>
The 'replace' property if it sets to true, replaces the element to which the directive is being applied with the directiv's template. The default value is <code>false</code>, in that case, the template is loaded as a child of the element to which the directive is being applied.
This is what we see if we inspect the element in both cases.
{% highlight html %}
<!-- replace: true -->
<li>
  <h3 class="ng-binding">Leanne Graham</h3>
  <h5 class="ng-binding">Sincere@april.biz</h5>
</li>
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html %}
<!-- replace: false -->
<user-element>
  <li>
    <h3 class="ng-binding">Leanne Graham</h3>
    <h5 class="ng-binding">Sincere@april.biz</h5>
  </li>
</user-element>
{% endhighlight %}

<h6 id="heading6">Transclude</h6>
<p>If the element that loads the directive has any child elements, They normally will be gone and replaced by the template of the directive. We set the transclude option to true if we want to get hold of the children of the element</p>
<h6 id="heading6">templateUrl</h6>
<p> We can define our content inline using the template option. or in most cases if the content is big and uses a lot of markup its better to separate it in its own file and load it using templateUrl</p>
<h6 id="heading6">Scope</h6>
<p>To use a custom directive to its fullest potential, we need to make sure its independent of the  parent controller/scope. The scope option help us to isolate the scope of the directive. However, we still have a way to pass data from the outer scope by using @, =, and & symbols.  the '@' symbole for one way data binding. i.e change on the directive won't update the parent scope. We use '=' for two way data binding, and '&' to pass down functions.</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
angular
  .module('app.users')
  .directive('userElement', userElement);

function userElement() {
  //Directive Definition Object
  var directive = {
    restrict: 'EA',
    replace: true,
    templateUrl: 'components/users/usersView.html',
    scope: {
      userInfo: '=',
    },
  }
  return directive;
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>And finally this is how you invoke the directive in the element intended</p>
{% highlight html %}
<div class="col-md-6 col-md-offset-3">
  <ul>
    <!-- name of the directive normalizes to snake case -->
    <user-element ng-repeat="user in usersCtrl.users" user-info="user"></user-element>
  </ul>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}
<p> I will explain the different life cycle functions of a directive in part 2.</p>
